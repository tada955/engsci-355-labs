# Data, Structure, and Logic

In this lab you will complete the remainder of the fourth phase of the HCCM framework, with your group.

## Define the Data

Firstly, you need to give detailed definitions of the data.
You may not have collected data during car making, but complete the following table that describes the kind of data you would need to collect to simulate car making.
Also add a comment on how the entry for CutTapeDuration would change if no person-by-person data was available, but an Exponential distribution that estimated the time it takes for a person to cut tape was available.
