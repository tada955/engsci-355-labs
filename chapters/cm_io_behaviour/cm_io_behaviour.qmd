# Inputs, Outputs, and Behaviour

In this lab you will complete the first three Phases of the HCCM framework, and part of the fourth, with your group.

## Understanding of the Problem Situation

In the box below write a problem description for making paper cars, think about what you are trying to solve/discover by simulating this activity.
You may want to look at @sec-hands-on-sim again to remind yourself about the process.

There are one or more people making cars from paper.
They need to trace the car template on the paper, then cut the car template out of the paper.
They then need to fold the car and use pieces of tape to stick it together.
They either cut the pieces of tape from the tape roll at the time they need them or cut them earlier and have them ready.
There are a limited number of pencils, templates, scissors, and tape rolls available for use.
The goal is to make as many cars as possible in 15 mins and determine the best way to do this given the number of people and resources to hand.

## Modelling Objectives

In the box below write the modelling objectives for making paper cars, i.e., what are you trying to discover using simulation?

- Determine how many cubes we can make in 15 mins
- Determine where the bottlenecks are
- Change task prioritization to see if we can make more cubes

## General Objectives

In the box below write the general objectives for making paper cars, i.e., what are some of the general properties you'd like your simulation to have?

- Run faster that 15 mins
- Be able to change inputs easily
- Get visualisations of outputs (could be as simple as confidence intervals or might be, e.g., distributions of \# of cars made

## Defining Output Responses

In the box below write the output responses for making paper cars, i.e., what are you going to measure to determine the performance of the system?

- Measure of how many cars can be made (for various different inputs)
- Waiting times of cars at various steps (bottlenecks)
- Idle time of people (waste)

## Defining Input Factors

In the box below write the input factors for making paper cars, i.e., what are you going to change to achieve the modelling objectives?
