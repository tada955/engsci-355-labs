# Inputs, Outputs, Entities, and Behaviour

In this lab and the next one, we will work through the Hierarchical Control Conceptual Modelling (HCCM) framework to build a conceptual model, aligned with the HCCM standard from lectures, that represents the practical activity, i.e., making paper cars, from @sec-hands-on-sim.

Working in the same groups as for practical activity, you will work through the phases for HCCM modelling shown below and complete templates for those steps.
In this lab you will complete phases 1, 2, 3, and start phase 4.
The remainder of phase 4 will be completed in the next lab.
@sec-hands-on-sim provides a partially completed conceptual model of the car making system that you can use as a starting point.

## Understanding of the Problem Situation

To understand the problem situation, you need to summarise what is happening in a concise way.
There is no strict rule for the best way to do this. One good approach is listening to the problem "holder", i.e., person/people who have the problem such as a client, then reflecting what you have heard in a couple of paragraphs with lists of key details and questions.
You can then work through one or more iterations of feedback and refinement to get a final, agreed upon problem description.

## Identification of Modelling and General Objectives

As described in lectures, there are two types of objectives to consider when developing a simulation:

> "The second step deals with the determination of the objectives. According to Robinson [26] they drive all aspects of the modeling process and are a subset of an organization's aims. Further, objectives can be classified into modeling and general objectives, where the latter are concerned with the flexibility, run-speed, visual-display and model/component reuse."

For the modelling objective you may like to think about what you trying to discover using simulation, and what level of performance you are trying to achieve in which areas/metrics.

## Defining Output Responses

Output responses are things that can be measured and compared to understand how a system has behaved/performed.
They are the metrics used to compare different simulation scenarios.
The output responses should let you know whether the modelling objectives have been achieved and why or how.
You may also want to consider how this will be reported (tables, graphs, etc.).

## Defining Input Factors

Input factors are things that can be changed and may modify how a system behaves/performs.
They are often defined to create multiple different scenarios to compare via simulation.
They are also what you can change to try and achieve the modelling objectives.

## Model Content

For the model content definition of our conceptual model we will follow the new HCCM standard.
This standard is presented in an academic article (currently under review) that is available on Canvas under \texttt{Files > Lectures > Conceptual Modelling} in the file 
[hccm-standard.pdf](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/113292/files/folder/Lectures/Conceptual%20Modelling?preview=12376819)

### Identifying Entities

Before formally defining entities it is often useful to identify entities in the system and whether they are active, i.e., have behaviour like a doctor or patient, or passive, i.e., are part of the system that should be modelled but that don't have explicit behaviour like a waiting room with a given capacity, but that doesn't actually have defined actions.
